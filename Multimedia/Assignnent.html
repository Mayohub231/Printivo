   <i>Dear Tayo</i>
   <p>  
    <strong> I received your letter last week and read about the incidents in your school last week with interest.It is very often that a school host a whole state sports festival for a full week.How fun it must have been for you</strong>
</p>
<p> How are you? How are your studiee? I hope you are coping in your name place.How is Mum and Dad
    <br>How are your siblings
</p>
<p>
    <b style="color: chocolate;"> In fact,I was most amused by what you had to say about our weather in Ogun State.It had very little to do with the things that are here.</b>
    <br style="color: chocolate;">I feel therefore that i musy write to correct some of your wrong impressions.A basic point which you must take note is that our state is very 
    <br style="color: chocolate;"> large state with different ethnic groups
    <p> Send my regards to Tolu,Tope,Titilayo and Mum and Dad</p>
